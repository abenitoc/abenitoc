### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Berto!
I'm a telecom engineer that is now working as Senior Software Engineer/Architect, more specialized in Frontend Development lately.
Among software engineering, my interests are functional programming ([Elm](http://elm-lang.org), Haskell soon), [Beam languages](https://github.com/llaisdy/beam_languages), accessibility, usability, mental models and probably some other things I'll be adding here if I remember.

You can contact me at bertocode@gmail.com
